## Overview  
Fake News Identifier is an AI-powered web tool designed to analyze and classify news headlines as **real** or **fake** using machine learning. It combines the predictive strengths of both **Naive Bayes** and **Passive-Aggressive** classifiers, enhanced with a **weighted voting ensemble method** for high-accuracy detection.
Leverages cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to evaluate content credibility.


## üìÇ Dataset  
- Source: [`train.csv`](fake-news/train.csv) from a fake news dataset
- Labels:  
  - `1` ‚Üí Fake News  
  - `0` ‚Üí Real News

## üõ†Ô∏è Features & Workflow  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Missing values handled and rows dropped.
   - Text cleaned, lowercased, and tokenized.
   - Stopwords removed and words stemmed with `PorterStemmer`.

2. **Text Vectorization**  
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer with 1‚Äì3 n-gram range and max 10,000 features.

3. **Model Training**  
   - **Naive Bayes Classifier** trained on TF-IDF features.  
   - **Passive-Aggressive Classifier** trained with confidence scores.

4. **Weighted Ensemble**  
   - Combines outputs from both models with weighted voting:  
     - Naive Bayes (65% weight)  
     - Passive-Aggressive (35% weight)  
   - Converts weighted score to final binary classification.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score plotted for:
     - Naive Bayes
     - Passive-Aggressive
     - Ensemble Method

6. **Model Persistence**  
   - Saves TF-IDF vectorizer and trained models using `joblib`.
